  "pillInfoHowToUseBody": "You must take one pill every day, at the same time each day. Consistency is very important. Most packs have 21 active pills and 7 placebo (sugar) pills, or 28 active pills. During the placebo week, you will likely have a withdrawal bleed, which is like a period.",
  "pillInfoWhatIfMissed": "What if I miss a pill?",
  "pillInfoWhatIfMissedBody": "If you miss one pill, take it as soon as you remember, even if it means taking two pills in one day. If you miss two or more pills, your risk of pregnancy increases. Take the last pill you missed, discard the other missed pills, and use a backup method of contraception (like a condom) for the next 7 days. Always read the leaflet that comes with your specific brand of pill or consult your doctor.",
